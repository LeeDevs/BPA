How all the code I (Lily) added works

The navigation bar works because of the style settings in style.css
the settings for
-ul {
-li a {
-li a.active {
-li a.inactive {
-li a:hover:not(.active) {

make the navigation bar work properly

The buttons on hotels.html are base on the design on the google doc, where clicking the button for the hotel one's staying at shows infromation for that location. 
The buttons work because of the following settings in style.css:
-.button {
-.button:hover {
-#myDIV {
=#myDIV2 {
-p.div {
-h3.div {

the .button and .button:hover deal with button appearence
the rest is for the divs that appear/disapear with the button click. 

(to be continued, the bell rang)
